## USING THE BOT

1. Find your bot in Telegram (by the name you specified when creating it)
2. Send the command `/start` to start working with the bot
3. Use the command `/pay` to create a new payment:
- Enter the payment amount
- Enter the payment description
- The bot will create the payment and send you a link for payment
4. Use the command `/payments` to view the payment history

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1. If you want the bot to run permanently on the server, look into ways to run scripts in the background (e.g. using systemd on Linux or a Windows service on Windows).

2. The bot saves all payment data to a SQLite database file (payments.db), which is created in the project folder.

3. If you want to use the bot in a production environment, don't forget to replace the Stripe test API key with a live one (starts with sk_live_).

## TROUBLESHOOTING

1. If Python is not found in the Windows command line:
- Make sure you checked "Add Python 3.9 to PATH" during installation
- Restart the command line

2. If you get errors installing dependencies:
- Make sure you are using Python 3.9
- Try updating pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

3. If the bot does not start due to an error with API keys:
- Check that the .env file is in the same folder as main.py
- Make sure there are no typos or extra spaces in the file

4. If the bot starts but does not respond in Telegram:
- Check that you entered the Telegram token correctly
- Make sure the bot has not been blocked by the user
- Try writing to the bot first (/start)

5. If you have problems with payments:
- Check that the Stripe API key is valid and active
- Make sure you don't use Cyrillic characters in the product name

For other issues, please refer to the Python documentation, python-telegram-bot and Stripe API.
